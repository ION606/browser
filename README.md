## Description
formerly "combi-app", this is my custom Electron browser

## Planned Features
1. control pannel (complete with all tabs, their usage, and various options for them)
2. social media integration (i.e. a built-in bluesky client)
3. plugin system
4. add customizable homepage
5. theme entire browser, add support for custom CSS/JS
6. maybe have support for a "default page script", like something run before each page load either for all pages or for each individual page
